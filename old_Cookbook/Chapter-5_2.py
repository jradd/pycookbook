'Write a file that does not exist '

'You want to write data to a file, but only if it doesnâ€™t already exist on the filesystem.'
' Just write a new file to system. '
# This problem is easily solved by using the little-known x mode to open() instead of the usual w mode. For example:


'Performing I.O Operations on s string'

import io
s = io.StringIO()

# write in.. <<
s.write("hi, my name is jyjdsaf")
print("this is a testoool;  ", file = s)
#get out all data written so far.

print(s.getvalue())



# read out <<
s = io.StringIO('Hello \r\t This is yjy speaking. \r\t' )
print(s.read(10) )
print(s.read())


# The io.StringIO class should only be used for text. If you are operating with binary data, use the io.BytesIO class instead. For example:



# binary .

"""  book instance
>>> s = io.BytesIO()
>>> s.write(b'binary data')
